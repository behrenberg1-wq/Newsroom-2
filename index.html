    <article>
      <p class="lead">“Taylor Swift released a new album. Big whoop.” That is one prevailing response to the recent release of Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl. Another is extreme excitement. More often than not, the primary reactions you’ve seen are the ones you already agree with.</p>

      <p>There is no question Taylor Swift stands alone at the pinnacle of contemporary pop stardom. In 2024 she concluded her record‑breaking, 149‑date Eras Tour, reportedly grossing over $2 billion in ticket sales and spawning both a companion book and a three‑hour concert film. Opinions on the quality of her music vary widely, but purely by the numbers, Swift’s success is impossible to understate.</p>

      <p>The Beliebers of the blog‑centric internet past are the incredibly devoted Swifties of today. First mentioned by Taylor Swift herself in a 2012 VEVO interview and later filed for trademark in 2017, “Swifties” was added to the Oxford English Dictionary by 2023. It’s easy to see why many feel so close to Taylor: they quite literally grew up with her music. Swift’s “Eras,” which formed the narrative core of her tour, are more than marketing categories — they are widely applicable life stories that allow listeners to relate and to place their own experiences within a shared timeline. These bonds often transcend traditional consumerism and take on a post‑postmodern fan culture, described by outlets like The Guardian and The Wall Street Journal as “The Taylor Swift effect.”</p>

      <p>The parasocial nature of the relationship between celebrity and fan amplifies this effect. As one Florida news piece puts it, “Anything Swift does takes the world by storm — from sold‑out concerts to a show‑stopping engagement. Every accomplishment of Swift’s feels like a win for her fandom.” Fans follow her closely and emotionally invest in her milestones; those feelings color how they react to and amplify news and art.</p>

      <p>But online, not all attention is genuine. On platforms like X (formerly Twitter), visibility and engagement can be gamed. Positive and negative comments alike push posts to be seen by more people, and bot farms have made it easier than ever to manufacture scale. This raises a pressing question: how much of the discourse around Taylor Swift is authentically human, and why do the most extreme takes — on both ends — seem the loudest?</p>

      <h2>Emotional intensity drives engagement</h2>

      <p>Research suggests that emotional intensity, not authenticity, is often the primary driver of online engagement. A 2017 Pew Research Center analysis found that engagement with political figures online skews with the extremity of views: more highly ideological actors spark larger conversations and more fervent defenders and attackers. Those with more extreme takes online spark larger discussions under their posts and easily have the most staunch defenders and attackers.</p>

      <figure>

        <img src="assets/engagement_vs_sentiment.png" alt="Scatter plot: Engagement vs Sentiment Intensity" />
        <figcaption>Engagement vs Sentiment Intensity — higher emotional intensity (positive or negative) correlates with larger total engagement in the sample Twitter dataset.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>A similar dynamic appears in music discourse. The tweets and posts that go viral tend to be those that express the most extreme emotional responses — fervent adoration or fierce disdain — regardless of whether those reactions come from verified or paid accounts, bots, or genuine users.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="assets/sentiment_by_verification.png" alt="Histogram: Sentiment Distribution by Verification Status" />
        <figcaption>Sentiment distribution by verification status — verified accounts skew more positive while unverified accounts show a wider spread of sentiment in this Twitter sample.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The disparity in sentiment between verified and unverified accounts on the subject of Taylor’s new album is palpable. Verified users, representative of journalists, official fan accounts, and otherwise known internet denizens trend towards positive sentiment, while free user sentiment is decidedly neutral overall.</p>

      <p><strong>queen of cups</strong>, an unverified X account comments, “I’ve listened to Taylor’s new album a couple of times now and I really like it. I’m not a huge swiftie but this is super easy listening and catchy.” The post has about 206 views, 9 likes, and 0 reposts.</p>

      <p><strong>Taylor Swift Updates</strong>, a verified X account comments, “A new Era is upon us</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I am always surprised the first time I listen to a Taylor Swift album. Besides the obvious. I'm always carrying some assumptions, expectations, predictions. And they're almost always thwarted.</p>
        <p>This feels so fresh, so transformed somehow. I'm sure we all have our theories about why. on a first listen it's slinky and bouncy, dancing by you in a hazy crowded room and looking back at you with a smile that slows time.</p>
        <p>Save your instant reactions and hot takes; this one is going to take some time and study to unfold. That's an expectation that's always come to pass.</p>
        <p>This album slaps and yes obviously Wood is my favorite.</p>
        <p>Congrats, my friend. Thanks for putting me in a video and giving us all a much needed family reunion..</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This post has about 390 thousand views, 11 thousand likes, and around 800 reposts. Enough to turn heads and change opinions, and quite honestly the difference between the attention the verified and unverified post gets is appalling, and unsurprising, and I would say that the unverified view is nice enough to not be overly positive, but still hover in the neutral side of opinions.</p>

      <h3>Measuring polarization with sentiment analysis</h3>

      <p>By using the top 5 most negative, and positive tweets about Taylor Swift’s new album, we can observe a clear polarization in public sentiment regarding her lifestyle, music, and public image. The data suggests two extremely contrasting patterns in online discourse surrounding the pop star: one being overly-negative sharing harsh criticism and hatred of the fanbase, and the other being hyper-positive, which portrays an intense adoration towards Taylor and her fandom.</p>

      <p>The tables use a NLTK Sentiment Analysis, which is a tool that allows us to represent the proportion of words in a phrase that express positivity and negativity. As the amount of emotional words increase in a phrase, the higher the score will be for that analyzed sentiment. The compound score is the combination of overall measured emotion being pulled from both emotional sentiment scores and combining them into a value between -1 (extremely negative) to +1 (extremely positive).</p>

      <p>Looking at the “Top 5 Most Negative Tweets” surrounding Taylor Swift’s new album you will find an extreme negative compound score with the highest being -0.9786, and the lowest being -0.8573. With that being said if you look at the “Top 5 Most Positive Tweets” you will find they are overly positive with the highest score being 0.9738 and the lowest being 0.9313. Obviously this is a small sample size of positive and negative comments surrounding Taylor Swift, but you can see from this data alone just how polarizing of a public figure she truly is when looking at both ends of the spectrum.</p>

      <p>These compound scores shown in the tables measure the polarization. When averaging across the full dataset, the overall compound score is 0.199, which indicates that online discussion surrounding Taylor Swift trends positively, however the emotional sentiment still varies drastically with much of the discourse still being on the lower end of positive.</p>
