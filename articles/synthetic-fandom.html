“Taylor Swift released a new album. Big whoop.” is one prevailing response to the recent release of Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl. Another is extreme excitement. I guarantee the primary reactions you’ve seen are the ones you already agree with.

It is no question that Taylor Swift stands alone at the pinnacle of pop stardom. In 2024, Swift concluded her record-breaking, 149-date Eras Tour, which reportedly grossed over $2 billion in ticket sales and spawned both a companion book and a three-hour concert film. Opinions on the quality of her music vary greatly, but purely based on the numbers, Taylor’s success as a pop idol icon is impossible to understate. 

The Beliebers of the fledgling blog-centric internet past are the incredibly devoted Swifties of today. First mentioned by Taylor Swift herself in a 2012 VEVO interview discussing some fans calling themselves as such, Swift would go on to file the term for trademark in 2017. By 2023, it was an official word in the Oxford English Dictionary. It’s easy to understand why many Swifties feel so close to Taylor. After all, they quite literally grew up with her music. Taylor’s “Eras” that were featured front and center in her tour of the same name don’t just serve as marketing categories – they serve to tell widely applicable stories of a woman from all times in her life. Indubitably, these bonds between Swift and Swiftie transcend traditional consumerism and take on a post-postmodern consumeristic style – or, as the Guardian and the Wall Street Journal put it, “The Taylor Swift effect”.

Additionally, according to a Florida news report article, Why Taylor Swift feels like a best friend: Inside parasocial relationships   “Anything Swift does takes the world by storm – from sold-out concerts to a show-stopping engagement. Every accomplishment of Swift’s feels like a win for her fandom, named "Swifties." They follow her like a loyal dog follows its owner, but the way these fans go about it is what many might consider slightly odd.

On websites like X, however, all publicity is oftentimes good publicity. Positive and negative comments alike will boost your post to be seen by more people. Online presence is easier to fake now than ever, with bot farms prevalent across politics and pop culture alike. Thus, it stands reasonable to ask, how much of this discourse is truly, authentically human, and why does it feel like the most extreme & absurd takes from both sides of the spectrum are the most prevalent online?

Per a 2017 study from the Pew Research Center, engagement with political figures online skews drastically proportional with how extreme the views of the figure is. Those with more extreme takes online spark larger discussions under their posts and easily have the most staunch defenders and attackers.
A similar effect is seen in today’s music discussion surrounding Taylor Swift. The most viral tweets came from both the most positive and most negative sentiment poles, illustrating that emotional intensity, not authenticity, drives engagement. This feedback loop amplifies polarization, giving many users the illusion that everyone either adores or despises Swift’s new work.


Since Elon Musk made the Twitter (currently X) verification badge purchasable, the blue checkmark doesn’t mean what it used to. Once a symbol of verified identity for public figures, journalists, and brands, the badge now mainly signals that an account pays for X Premium. Now visibility can be bought and influence can be artificially amplified rather than earned. It’s harder now than ever on X to tell whether a viral opinion truly represents genuine fandom.

The disparity in sentiment between verified and unverified accounts on the subject of Taylor’s new album is palpable. Verified users, representative of journalists, official fan accounts, and otherwise known internet denizens trend towards positive sentiment, while free user sentiment is decidedly neutral overall.



queen of cups, an unverified X account comments, “I’ve listened to Taylor’s new album a couple of times now and I really like it. I’m not a huge swiftie but this is super easy listening and catchy.” The post has about 206 views, 9 likes, and 0 reposts.


Taylor Swift Updates, a verified X account comments, “A new Era is upon us

I am always surprised the first time I listen to a Taylor Swift album. Besides the obvious. I'm always carrying some assumptions, expectations, predictions. And they're almost always thwarted.

This feels so fresh, so transformed somehow. I'm sure we all have our theories about why. on a first listen it's slinky and bouncy, dancing by you in a hazy crowded room and looking back at you with a smile that slows time.

Save your instant reactions and hot takes; this one is going to take some time and study to unfold. That's an expectation that's always come to pass.

This album slaps and yes obviously Wood is my favorite.

Congrats, my friend. Thanks for putting me in a video and giving us all a much needed family reunion..”
This post has about 390 thousand views, 11 thousand likes, and around 800 reposts. Enough to turn heads and change opinions, and quite honestly the difference between the attention the verified and unverified post gets is appalling, and unsurprising, and I would say that the unverified view is nice enough to not be overly positive, but still hover in the neutral side of opinions.  

By using the top 5 most negative, and positive tweets about Taylor Swift’s new album, we can observe a clear polarization in public sentiment regarding her lifestyle, music, and public image. The data suggests two extremely contrasting patterns in online discourse surrounding the pop star: one being overly-negative sharing harsh criticism and hatred of the fanbase, and the other being hyper-positive, which portrays an intense adoration towards Taylor and her fandom.

The tables use a NLTK Sentiment Analysis, which is a tool that allows us to represent the proportion of words in a phrase that express positivity and negativity. As the amount of emotional words increase in a phrase, the higher the score will be for that analyzed sentiment. The compound score is the combination of overall measured emotion being pulled from both emotional sentiment scores and combining them into a value between -1 (extremely negative) to +1 (extremely positive) 

Looking at the “Top 5 Most Negative Tweets” surrounding Taylor Swift’s new album you will find an extreme negative compound score with the highest being -0.9786, and the lowest being -0.8573. With that being said if you look at the “Top 5 Most Positive Tweets” you will find they are overly positive with the highest score being 0.9738 and the lowest being 0.9313. Obviously this is a small sample size of positive and negative comments surrounding Taylor Swift, but you can see from this data alone just how polarizing of a public figure she truly is when looking at both ends of the spectrum.




These compound scores shown in the tables measure the polarization. When averaging across the full dataset, the overall compound score is 0.199, which indicates that online discussion surrounding Taylor Swift trends positively, however the emotional sentiment still varies drastically with much of the discourse still being on the lower end of positive.
