      <p class="lead">“Taylor Swift released a new album. Big whoop.” That is one prevailing response to the recent release of Taylor Swift’s The Life of a Showgirl. Another is extreme excitement. More often than not, the primary reactions you’ve seen are the ones you already agree with.</p>

      <p>There is no question Taylor Swift stands alone at the pinnacle of contemporary pop stardom. In 2024 she concluded her record‑breaking, 149‑date Eras Tour, reportedly grossing over $2 billion in ticket sales and spawning both a companion book and a three‑hour concert film. Opinions on the quality of her music vary widely, but purely by the numbers, Swift’s success is impossible to understate.</p>

      <p>The Beliebers of the blog‑centric internet past are the incredibly devoted Swifties of today. First mentioned by Taylor Swift herself in a 2012 VEVO interview and later filed for trademark in 2017, “Swifties” was added to the Oxford English Dictionary by 2023. It’s easy to see why many feel so close to Taylor: they quite literally grew up with her music. Swift’s “Eras,” which formed the narrative core of her tour, are more than marketing categories — they are widely applicable life stories that allow listeners to relate and to place their own experiences within a shared timeline. These bonds often transcend traditional consumerism and take on a post‑postmodern fan culture, described by outlets like The Guardian and The Wall Street Journal as “The Taylor Swift effect.”</p>

      <h2>Emotional intensity drives engagement</h2>

      <p>Research suggests that emotional intensity, not authenticity, is often the primary driver of online engagement. A 2017 Pew Research Center analysis found that engagement with political figures online skews with the extremity of views: more highly ideological actors spark larger conversations and more fervent defenders and attackers. Those with more extreme takes online spark larger discussions under their posts and easily have the most staunch defenders and attackers.</p>

        <figcaption>Engagement vs Sentiment Intensity — higher emotional intensity (positive or negative) correlates with larger total engagement in the sample Twitter dataset.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>A similar dynamic appears in music discourse. The tweets and posts that go viral tend to be those that express the most extreme emotional responses — fervent adoration or fierce disdain — regardless of whether those reactions come from verified or paid accounts, bots, or genuine users.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>The disparity in sentiment between verified and unverified accounts on the subject of Taylor’s new album is palpable. Verified users, representative of journalists, official fan accounts, and otherwise known internet denizens trend towards positive sentiment, while free user sentiment is decidedly neutral overall.</p>

      <h3>Measuring polarization with sentiment analysis</h3>

      <p>By using the top 5 most negative, and positive tweets about Taylor Swift’s new album, we can observe a clear polarization in public sentiment regarding her lifestyle, music, and public image. The data suggests two extremely contrasting patterns in online discourse surrounding the pop star: one being overly-negative sharing harsh criticism and hatred of the fanbase, and the other being hyper-positive, which portrays an intense adoration towards Taylor and her fandom.</p>
